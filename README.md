Introduction to CNNs in Audio

CNNs excel at learning spatial hierarchies from grid-based data
Convert audio waveforms into 2D Mel spectrograms (time-frequency representation)
Use convolution layers for feature extraction from spectrograms
Spectrograms capture time vs frequency energy patterns
CNN learn pitch, rhythm, and other audio features

these would eventually help in these Project Objective :

Environmental sound classification is vital for surveillance, smart cities, wildlife conservation.
Manual labeling is expensive and time-consuming.
Compare Active Learning (iterative, query-driven labelling) and Passive Learning (fixed labeled dataset) for sound classification.
Recommend the optimal method based on the data and requirements.
